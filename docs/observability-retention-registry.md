# Retention and Read-Amplification Registry

Issue: #2036. This is PR 08 of 23 in the observability sequence (#2029–#2051),
the documentation/policy gate that ratifies the complete retention and
read-amplification matrix for every durable stream under `.swarm/` and the
platform-data roots. It blocks PRs 09–23 until every row below carries an
owner-approved final disposition.

**The canonical, field-complete record is machine-readable** (registry data schema version: `RETENTION_REGISTRY_SCHEMA_VERSION`, currently 1, exported alongside the rows)**:**
`scripts/retention-registry.data.ts` (`RETENTION_REGISTRY`). Every row there
carries ALL issue-required columns — path grammar, canonical root, writer
symbols, reader symbols, schema/version, state class, privacy class,
byte/age/count limits with global-vs-per-trigger/per-key scope, read byte
bound with sync/async behavior, lock/concurrency model, crash behavior,
close/archive/reset policy, legacy compatibility, health signal, owner, and
final disposition. The CI gate `bun run check:retention`
(`scripts/check-retention-registry.ts`) enforces: every durable-writing
module under `src/` is registered (or on the explicit plumbing exemption
list), every disposition is one of the three allowed kinds with a resolvable
citation, and every row id appears in this document as a backtick-wrapped
slug. This document renders the matrix per category and records the evidence.
**Provenance and canonicity:** the tables below are a hand-maintained
rendering of the data module — no committed generator exists; when a row
changes, update the matching table cell by hand. The mechanically enforced
doc↔data contract is row-id presence, NOT table-cell equality; the data
module is canonical wherever the two disagree.

Companion documents: `docs/observability-event-contract.md` (the 17-store
producer/consumer matrix at correlation granularity, PR 01) and
`docs/engineering-invariants.md` (the #2036 invariant entry). Sequence
context: parents #1823/#2025; amendment issue #2309 (residual unowned
streams).

## Method (how this registry was built)

Base tree `main` @ `79fbf3ae` (PRs 01–07, #2029–#2035, merged); citations
were verified against the source tree during the gate's localization passes
(8 parallel subsystem lanes + a gap lane + main-thread conflict resolution)
and re-verified through independent review — including every "no reader"
claim, one of which was corrected during review. The writer universe was enumerated mechanically (Appendix A)
and cross-checked against PR 07's `WRITER_CLASSIFICATION`
(`src/utils/atomic-write.ts:358-450`). Dispositions were validated against the
open issues' own "independently verified cause" sections — the sequence issues
(#2037–#2042, #2046) confirm the same root causes independently.

## Legends

- **State class** — `authoritative` (the record IS the domain fact),
  `operational` (telemetry/diagnostic signal), `derived-rebuildable`
  (projection of authoritative state or rebuildable cache),
  `governed-content` (knowledge/evidence artifacts under retention governance).
- **Privacy class** — `metadata` (structured/discriminator-only records: ids,
  counters, event kinds, timing — no free-text payload), `content` (streams
  whose primary payload is free text: lessons, reports, skills, messages,
  agent work product), `mixed` (both). The line is the payload, not the file
  type: an insight candidate awaiting promotion carries the same lesson bytes
  the knowledge store does, so the feeder queue is `content` exactly like its
  destination (issue #2036 scenario 5 forbids reclassifying content as
  metadata to sample it freely).
- **Limit scope** — `global` (one ceiling for the whole store),
  `per-trigger` (bounded only per invocation), `per-key` (per task/skill/file
  etc. — **must also declare `writeLimits.keyspaceBound`**, see the keyspace
  rule below), `session-scoped` (bounded by the close/finalize lifecycle),
  `none` (verified unbounded → always a fix-in-issue row).
- **Keyspace bound** (`writeLimits.keyspaceBound`) — for `per-key` rows, what
  makes the *set of keys* finite, with a `path:line` citation. Optional on the
  TypeScript type because it is meaningless for the other scopes; **required by
  the gate** for every `per-key` row whose disposition is not `fix-in-issue`.
- **Direct-file exemption** (`directFileExemption`, issue #2483 ratchet rung 1)
  — for rows with state class `authoritative` whose path grammar is a
  direct-file store (does not route through `swarm.db`): a reviewed reason
  restating the row's own durability justification, plus the issue under which
  it was reviewed. **Required by the gate** for every authoritative
  direct-file row; new authoritative stores belong in `swarm.db` unless a
  reviewed reason exempts them. Rendered in the Disposition column below as
  "direct-file exemption (#NNNN)".
- **Disposition** (issue #2036 rule — no owner waiver):
  - **fix in #NNNN** — a linked implementation issue in the sequence, or the
    sequence-amendment issue #2309 opened under #2036's amendment clause;
  - **retain by design** — cites the authoritative durability/lifecycle
    requirement plus the bounded reader/close proof;
  - **not a defect** — cites the source proof (bounded queue, batch-scoped
    artifact, or hard byte bound).
  - `defer` / `TBD` / `unknown` / "future issue" are not completed rows; the
    check rejects them.

## The three-way rule for full-file readers (acceptance criterion)

Every current full-file reader in the registry satisfies exactly one of:
(1) a **hard source-proven byte bound** — e.g. telemetry rotation caps both
generations at ≤20 MiB; `skill-usage` is now a hard global byte/age/count
bound (`SKILL_USAGE_LIMITS`, issue #2038) backed by the authoritative
`skill-usage-pending` sidecar, not a FIFO cap; changelog/knowledge lists are
FIFO-capped;
(2) a **linked fix PR** — #2039 (events), #2040 (shell-audit), #2037
(context-telemetry), #2041 (PRM), #2042 (subscriptions);
(3) an **authoritative lifecycle rationale** — plan-ledger replay, receipts-v2
queries, evaluation-store integrity reads, memory-store loads (all
cap-bounded or authoritative-by-contract).
No correctness state is classified as sampleable operational telemetry, and no
content-bearing stream is reclassified as metadata (privacy classes are
recorded per row in the data module).

## The keyspace rule for `per-key` limits (issue #2038 recurrence guardrail)

**The defect class.** A retention policy scoped *per key* was mistaken for a
global bound. A per-key cap bounds each key's history but **not the store**:
steady-state size is `O(distinct-keys × per-key-cap)`, which is a ceiling only
when the *keyspace* is finite. In issue #2038 the keyspace was `skillPath` —
one key per distinct skill name, with no limit on how many exist — so a
500-entry-per-skill prune produced growth with no ceiling. The row passed CI
because the gate constrained only `scope: 'none'` and said nothing whatsoever
about `per-key`.

**The rule.** A row with `writeLimits.scope === 'per-key'` whose disposition is
**not** `fix-in-issue` MUST declare `writeLimits.keyspaceBound`. The value names
what makes the keyspace finite and cites `path:line` evidence. A keyspace is
finite iff **either**

1. the key domain is a **closed set** — a TypeScript enum/union, or an index
   bounded by a max-concurrency constant; **or**
2. something **deletes keys** and that deleter's trigger is **global**, not
   per-key.

A per-key cap is never an answer to this field — it is the thing the field
exists to qualify. `fix-in-issue` rows are exempt: they already declare the
stream a defect under a named owning issue, so there is nothing to whitewash.

**The gate rejects two failures**, both in `collectKeyspaceBoundErrors`
(`scripts/check-retention-registry.ts`), and both name #2038 in the message:

- the field is **missing or empty** on a non-`fix-in-issue` `per-key` row; or
- the field is present but **declares the keyspace not finite** (matching
  `unbounded`, `no … ceiling`, `nothing deletes/reaps/removes/prunes`) while the
  disposition still claims the stream is fine. Admitting the defect in prose is
  not a way to keep a `not-a-defect` disposition — such a row must become
  `fix-in-issue`. The `skill-changelogs` row is the reference example of that
  admission carried honestly, under #2309.

`keyspaceBound` is also swept for the no-owner-waiver strings (`TBD`, `defer`,
`unknown`, "future issue") and its cited paths are rot-checked like every other
citation.

**Why a CI check and not a stronger rung.** The obligation is a *conjunction*
across sibling fields — `writeLimits.scope === 'per-key'` **and**
`disposition.kind !== 'fix-in-issue'` — and `disposition` is a sibling of
`writeLimits`, not a member of it, so no discriminated union on `scope` can
express it; narrowing `scope` alone would force the field onto the
`fix-in-issue` rows the rule deliberately exempts. A type can also require
presence but check neither non-emptiness nor whether the prose answers the
question (`keyspaceBound: ''` typechecks). A lint rule is the wrong tool: this
is a cross-field semantic property of one project data file, keyed on values
rather than code shape. And there is no runtime rung — the registry lives under
`scripts/` and is deliberately never loaded by the plugin (AGENTS.md invariants
1 and 2). A CI check over the data artifact is the strongest available rung, and
it is the same rung the sibling `scope: 'none'` rule already occupies.

**Applying the rule to the existing registry found two live instances of the
#2038 class**, both previously carrying a `not-a-defect` disposition whose only
proof was a per-key cap. Both were filed `fix-in-issue` under #2309 and kept
their `keyspaceBound` fields as the source evidence; **issue #2483 closed both
gaps** and both rows are back to `not-a-defect` with compliant keyspace bounds:

- `test-history` (`.swarm/cache/test-history.jsonl`) — the #2038 evidence: a
  per-key FIFO of 20 over a `(testFile, testName)` key that re-emitted the
  newest 20 of *every* key, evicting no key ever. #2483 closed it with the
  GLOBAL caps `MAX_TEST_HISTORY_ENTRIES` 5000 + `MAX_TEST_HISTORY_KEYS` 1000
  enforced in the read-prune-write pass on every append
  (`src/test-impact/history-store.ts`).
- `pr-feedback-event-queues` (`.swarm/pr-feedback-events/{session-stem}.json`
  plus its `.meta.json` sidecar)
  — the #2038 evidence: one file per session id with the 200-session FIFO
  evicting only from an in-process `Map`. #2483 closed it with the retention
  sweep's `pr-feedback-events` family (30 d age-prune,
  `src/retention/sweep.ts`).

They had been filed under #2309 because it owned this exact shape for
`skill-changelogs`; #2483 also closed that verify item with the global entry
ceiling `MAX_SKILL_CHANGELOG_GLOBAL_ENTRIES` (10000, enforced on every append).
**The recurrence hatch is closed too**: the checker's `RESOLVED_SCOPE_ISSUES`
rung (issue #2483) rejects any new `fix-in-issue` disposition naming #2309,
#2045, #2046, #2047, #2048, or #2483 — pointing at a resolved umbrella no
longer passes.

## The close-lifecycle rule for `.swarm/` artifacts (issue #1534 recurrence guardrail)

**The defect class.** A durable `.swarm/` artifact whose *creation* is wired but
whose `/swarm close` *lifecycle* is not. Issue #1534 added `repo-memory.sqlite`
(a WAL-mode SQLite index) and three wirings were each nearly omitted:

- **(a)** the artifact is absent from `ARCHIVE_ARTIFACTS` /
  `ACTIVE_STATE_TO_CLEAN`, so `/swarm close` orphans it;
- **(b)** a SQLite artifact is archived by raw file copy instead of
  `archiveSqliteSnapshot` (VACUUM INTO) — not a transactionally consistent
  snapshot of a WAL-mode DB, so committed rows still in the `-wal` sidecar are
  lost and an in-flight writer can be captured mid-transaction;
- **(c)** the cached DB handle is not closed before `fs.unlink`, which fails
  with `EBUSY` **on Windows only** — invisible on a Linux CI host.

Before this rule the registry already forced every durable writer to have a
row, and each row declared a prose `closePolicy` — but nothing verified that a
row claiming "archived"/"cleaned" actually appeared in the close-stage arrays.

**The rule.** Every `project-swarm` row whose `pathGrammar` names a literal flat
`.swarm/<file>` MUST declare `closeArrayMembership` for that file, one of
`archive+clean` / `archive-only` / `clean-only` / `neither`. The value states
**array membership only** — deliberately, because that is what is mechanically
checkable; the prose `closePolicy` remains the place for narrative such as
"context.md is archived and separately rewritten to a stub". Conversely, every
artifact the close stages wire into either array must be declared by **exactly one**
row, or appear in the frozen `CLOSE_ARTIFACTS_WITHOUT_REGISTRY_ROW` allowlist
(which may only shrink).

**The gate**, `collectCloseLifecycleCoherenceErrors`
(`scripts/check-retention-registry.ts`), parses the real arrays and dispatch
sites out of `src/commands/close/{constants,archive-stage,clean-stage}.ts` via `scripts/close-lifecycle-facts.ts` and
rejects:

- a declaration that disagrees with the close stages (sub-defect **a**);
- an archived `.db`/`.sqlite`/`.sqlite3` artifact outside the
  `archiveSqliteSnapshot` dispatch condition (sub-defect **b**);
- a cleaned SQLite artifact with no `closeXxx(...)` handle-close guard before
  the unlink in `runCleanStage` (sub-defect **c**);
- a close-stage artifact no row declares, or that two rows declare;
- a `project-swarm` row whose `pathGrammar` does not start with `.swarm/`
  (which would silently exempt it), unless listed in
  `PROJECT_SWARM_ROWS_WITH_INDIRECT_ROOT`;
- a declared flat `.swarm/` SQLite artifact whose membership is anything other
  than `archive+clean`, unless listed in the frozen (today empty)
  `SQLITE_ARTIFACTS_EXEMPT_FROM_ARCHIVE_CLEAN` map with a reason. Without this
  last rule an author could reintroduce sub-defect **(a)** verbatim by
  declaring a new `.swarm/*.sqlite` as `neither`: the declaration would match
  the close stages, and the VACUUM-INTO and handle-close rules would never fire because
  they key on real array membership. A WAL-mode database orphaned across
  `/swarm close` must be an explicit, reviewed exception — never a quiet
  `neither`.

**Fail-closed, never vacuous.** Every fact is parsed from source, so parser rot
would otherwise yield a silently green run. Unparsed array entries and
unresolvable identifiers become errors rather than dropped artifacts, and the
gate additionally requires both arrays to be non-empty and `swarm.db` to appear
in *both* SQLite sets — facts true independently of any artifact a given change
adds. `tests/unit/scripts/check-retention-close-lifecycle.test.ts` drives the
collectors with synthetic close-stage source for each sub-defect.

**Why the CI-check rung.** `tsconfig.json` is a single config with
`include: ["src/**/*"]` and no CI step runs `tsc` over `scripts/`, so a required
field on `RetentionRow` would be enforced by zero gates. Even with a `scripts/`
tsconfig a type could require the field's *presence* but never that its value
*matches* the close stages, which is the whole invariant — the type rung is a
complement, not a substitute. Biome's configured scope is `src/**` and
`tests/**`, and the property is cross-artifact semantics keyed on data values
rather than code shape. And the registry is build-time
documentation-as-data under `scripts/`, deliberately never loaded by the plugin
(AGENTS.md invariants 1 and 2), so there is no runtime in which to assert it.

## Close/reset/archive reconciliation (acceptance criterion)

`/swarm close` (finalize) semantics are recorded per row. The reconciled sets
(read from `src/commands/close/constants.ts` on the gate tree): `ARCHIVE_ARTIFACTS`
(:16-95 — including `repo-graph.fingerprint.json` :42 and
`epic-state.json`/`turbo-state.json` :441-442, #2483 additions),
`ACTIVE_STATE_TO_CLEAN` (:150-195 — fingerprint :166, epic-state/turbo-state
:189-190), `ACTIVE_STATE_DIRS_TO_CLEAN` (:253-269 — coder-settlements,
council, evidence, session, scopes, spec-archive, task-repairs, task-terminals,
plus the #2483 additions `runs`/`epic` :267-268), dynamic artifacts
(post-mortem-*.md; drift-report-phase-*.json; config-backup-*; plan-ledger
siblings; SWARM_PLAN checkpoints), deliberate exclusions (locks/;
knowledge.jsonl archived-not-cleaned; swarm.db -wal/-shm removed post-unlink by
`removeSqliteSidecarsAfterClose`, #2483 reversing #1692). Nothing in this
registry is simultaneously "deleted" and "needed for recovery": every
destructive path has a preservation mechanism — close archives before cleaning
(archive-first guard), reset-session backs up to `.swarm/reset-backups/`
(retention 5), ledger truncation archives the original before replacement,
residue and receipt tails are quarantined with rollback, and the retention
sweep (`src/retention/sweep.ts`, #2483) owns the 30 d keyspace families listed
per row.

## Appendix A — committed enumeration evidence

Commands run from the repo root on `main` @ `79fbf3ae` (deterministic;
re-runnable):

```bash
# Durable-write API call sites in src/ (excluding tests)
rg -n "writeFileSync|appendFileSync|appendFile\(|createWriteStream" src --type ts \
  -g '!**/__tests__/**' -g '!*.test.ts'
# Result: 190 matches across 103 files

# fs/promises-style writers (critic-required probe — closes the bare-writeFile hole)
rg -n "\.writeFile\(|[^A-Za-z]writeFile\(" src --type ts -g '!*.test.ts' \
  | grep -v "atomicWriteFile\|writeFileSync\|writeFileAtomic\|writeFileFsynced"
# Result: 20 sites — all registered rows (see the data module writerModules)

# SQLite schema/open sites
rg -n "CREATE TABLE" src --type ts -g '!**/__tests__/**' -g '!*.test.ts'
# Result: 18 sites — db/global-db.ts (3), db/project-db.ts (5),
# memory/sqlite-provider.ts (9), memory/memory-family-migration.ts (1)

# The gate's own enumeration (single source of truth going forward)
bun run scripts/check-retention-registry.ts
# Result: "Retention registry check passed: 99 rows … every enumerated writer
# module is registered or exempt."
# (Enumeration-time count. The registry has since grown — issue #2309/#2483
# ratification rows among them; the live row count is what the gate reports
# today, 109 as of the #2483 close — and Appendix A is retained verbatim as
# the committed evidence of the ORIGINAL enumeration only.)
```

The enumerator's pattern set (write APIs + atomic-write helper calls + SQLite
open/acquire seams +, since issue #2480, the swarm.db **store-op seam** —
every durable store mutation is a named, enumerated function) and the complete
writer-module-to-row mapping live in `scripts/retention-registry.data.ts`
(`writerModules` per row plus `EXEMPT_WRITER_MODULES`, 7 plumbing entries).
**DB-mediated boundary (#2480 redesign):** raw `Database`-handle references
outside `src/db/**` are confined to `RAW_DB_HANDLE_MODULES` (each member owned
by a registry row), and `src/db` foundation writers are reverse-staleness
checked (a registered foundation module that stops calling any enumerated seam
fails the gate). Honest boundary: this is an enumerated-seam ratchet, not a
type-system guarantee — a `db.run(INSERT…)` on a handle smuggled past the
confinement list would still be invisible; the confinement list is the
enforced surface, and growing it requires a reviewed registry change.
Further, deliberately documented seams: (a)
**helper indirection** — a handful of modules write only through shared
transaction helpers (`transactKnowledge`/`transactFile` and friends) and are
registered by OWNERSHIP in `writerModules` rather than by a literal write-call
match in their own source; (b) **copy/rename materialization** — a durable
stream can be materialized by `copyFileSync`/`renameSync` without any write-API
call (the known instance, `src/commands/skill-opt.ts:231` copying eval inputs
under `.swarm/evolution/skills/_eval-input/`, is registered on the
skill-optimizer-evolution row). `copyFileSync` is deliberately NOT a ratchet
pattern because read-side snapshot copies (e.g. cost-accounting's telemetry
temp copy) would be false positives; (c) **raw Bun-native write APIs** —
`Bun.write(`, `Bun.file(...).writer(`, and fd-level `fs.writeSync` are not
matched (zero instances in `src/` today; AGENTS.md already bars direct
`Bun.*` calls outside `src/utils/bun-compat.ts`, and the wrapper's `bunWrite`
IS matched); and (d) **comment/string-literal false positives** — the
line-comment stripper only removes lines that START with `//`, so write APIs
mentioned inside block comments, string literals, or trailing comments still
match. That direction is fail-closed (a non-writer gets flagged and must be
registered or exempted with a reason) — the safe failure mode for a coverage
gate. Finally, citation existence checks are case-sensitive exactly like the
Linux CI that enforces the gate; a case-mismatched citation could pass a
case-insensitive local filesystem and fail only in CI. Line citations in the
data module were verified against
the gate tree and are ungated "verified as of" pointers (the same caveat the
PR 01 matrix carries); the mechanical guarantees are the coverage ratchet and
the disposition rules.

## Appendix B — issue link index (all disposition owners)

Verified resolvable on 2026-08-22 via `gh issue view`:

- Sequence (merged; cited as retain/not-defect proof or context): #2029,
  #2030, #2031, #2032, #2033, #2034, #2035.
- Sequence (open; fix-in-issue owners): #2037, #2038, #2039, #2040, #2041,
  #2042, #2045, #2046, #2047, #2048, #2049, #2050, #2051.
- Amendment issue (CLOSED by #2483): #2309 — residual unowned durable streams
  (knowledge-retractions, unacknowledged-criticals, curation-proposals,
  consolidation-log, runs/, context-snapshot.md, epic/calibration +
  divergence + state maps, skill-improver proposals, evolution/skills
  lifecycle ledgers, capsules, summaries, repo-graph fingerprint orphan,
  pr-review run artifacts, review receipts, doc-drift signals; verify items:
  skill-changelog global ceiling, skills proposals accumulation). #2483
  installed the writer caps, retention sweep, and close wiring that bound
  every one of these streams and re-dispositioned all of their rows; the
  issue #2038 keyspace reclassifications (`test-history`,
  `pr-feedback-event-queues`) are likewise closed. The checker's
  `RESOLVED_SCOPE_ISSUES` rung (#2483) rejects any new `fix-in-issue`
  disposition naming #2309, #2045, #2046, #2047, #2048, or #2483.
- Open follow-ups that inherited the planned-stream rows: #2485 (OTLP
  export, from #2049), #2486 (training vault, from #2050), #2487 (legacy
  retirement, from #2051 — the recorded migration owner for telemetry.jsonl
  and knowledge-application.jsonl).
- Parents: #1823, #2025. This gate: #2036.

## Appendix C — full-resolution contract checklist

- Fresh-main inventory (main @ `79fbf3ae`, PRs 01-07 merged): yes — Appendix A.
- Unique release fragment:
  `docs/releases/pending/2036-retention-read-amplification-registry.md`.
- No missing/ambiguous/deferred row: enforced by `check:retention`
  (disposition kinds, forbidden strings, citation resolution).
- No cleanup authorization based on size alone: the retain-by-design rows
  that resist deletion (archive bundles, evolution store, hive quarantine)
  cite durability requirements, not size; no row authorizes new deletion.
- No unowned legacy reader: every row's legacy compatibility is recorded in
  the data module; retirement ownership for the two legacy streams is #2051.
- Independent reviewer + final critic approval: recorded in the PR.
