/**
 * Promotion-evidence store (issue #1849 §B2).

 * Append-only, FIFO-bounded, rebuildable projection of
 * {@link PromotionEvidenceRecord}s produced when an authoritative V2 terminal
 * receipt (applied/violated/contradicted) is filed. V2 receipt history remains
 * the authority if this projection write fails. This is the wiring that feeds #1847's
 * {@link evaluatePromotionPolicy} consumer (previously inert "until #1849
 * produces real receipts").
 *
 * Per-worktree by design: promotion evidence records THIS worktree's observed
 * applications. It is intentionally NOT a member of `KNOWLEDGE_FAMILY` (the
 * linked-cohort shared-artifact manifest), matching the precedent set by the
 * former Epic promotion-evidence log. It lives under the project-root
 * `.swarm/` (via {@link validateSwarmPath}), NOT the link-aware shared store
 * dir, so it stays per-worktree.
