/**
 * Active-state flat files to clean after archiving so future swarms start clean.
 *
 * plan.json, plan.md, and plan-ledger.jsonl are all removed so the next /swarm
 * session starts with a clean slate. The user's original ask for /swarm close
 * was to "archive plan files so future swarms aren't confused" — leaving a
 * terminal-state plan.json in place violates that invariant because the next
 * session's loadPlan() would pick it up as if it were still active.
 *
 * CRITICAL: the ledger must also be removed. Without this, loadPlan()'s Step 4
 * would see no plan.json but a surviving ledger, call replayFromLedger(), and
 * materialize the CLOSED plan back into plan.json on the next session. The
 * ledger is a second backing store for the same "terminal-state plan" and
 * leaving it behind re-enables the exact bug this cleanup is meant to fix.
 * The archive-first guard below ensures we only delete files we successfully
 * copied to the archive bundle, so the audit trail is preserved in the bundle.
 *
 * knowledge-rejected.jsonl, repo-graph.json, doc-manifest.json,
 * dark-matter.md, telemetry.jsonl, and swarm.db are
 * session-generated artifacts that do not persist meaningfully across sessions —
 * they are recreated on next session init and must be removed to avoid stale-state
 * interference.
 *
 * The SQLite WAL sidecars swarm.db-shm and swarm.db-wal are deliberately NOT in
 * either list (the archive-first guard would preserve them anyway): since #2483
 * they are removed immediately AFTER the swarm.db unlink by
 * removeSqliteSidecarsAfterClose, deliberately reversing #1692. Post-unlink the
 * sidecar paths are meaningless for future opens (no new opener can attach),
 * live processes keep their already-open fds so deleting the PATH cannot
 * corrupt them, and a Windows open-handle collision yields EBUSY which the
 * helper skips fail-open.
 *
 * Note: knowledge.jsonl is intentionally NOT cleaned because it contains cumulative
 * project knowledge (lessons learned) that should persist across sessions and finalize
 * cycles. The archive step still creates a backup for safety.
 * close-summary.md is NOT cleaned because it is written as the final close output
 * AFTER the clean stage runs. spec.md IS cleaned: it is single-session state coupled
 * to the plan lifecycle (the plan it produced is removed above), so leaving it behind
 * makes the next session pick up a stale spec via readEffectiveSpecSync and mis-route
 * the architect into CLARIFY-SPEC/overwrite prompts. It is archived first (archive-first
 * guard), so the forensic copy is preserved in the bundle. The earlier "spec.md may not
 * exist" rationale was wrong — handoff.md is equally optional and is cleaned the same way.
 * session-reflection.md is a single-session snapshot (not cumulative like
 * knowledge.jsonl) so it IS cleaned to maintain the clean-slate invariant.
 * spec-staleness.json and spec-snapshot.md are the same class of single-session
 * spec-drift state as spec.md. spec-staleness.json is an existence-only gate
 * checked unconditionally by enforceSpecDriftGate, which hard-blocks the core
 * write tools (save_plan, update_task_status, phase_complete,
 * lean_turbo_run_phase, lean_turbo_acquire_locks) with SPEC_DRIFT_BLOCK — a
 * survivor would block the NEXT session against drift that no longer applies.
 * spec-snapshot.md is its companion diff source, feeding the mismatch shown in
 * the SPEC_DRIFT_BLOCK message. Both are archived first (archive-first guard),
 * then cleaned so the next session starts drift-free.
