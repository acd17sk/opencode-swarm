 * Compile-time snapshot-field parity map (issue #2472 W6 / AC-7; frozen check C7).

 * WHY THIS MAP EXISTS — the serializer reads FROM `AgentSessionState` and
 * writes TO `SerializedAgentSession`, so the drift-prone direction is a field
 * that exists on the live state but silently never reaches the snapshot:
 * nothing fails, the field is just lost on every restart. The
 * `Record<Exclude<keyof AgentSessionState, keyof SerializedAgentSession>, string>`
 * key type makes that direction exhaustive at compile time — EVERY state field
 * that is not a serialized field MUST appear here with a one-line rationale,
 * and a key that is NOT such a field is an excess-property type error. Adding
 * a field to either interface without reconciling this map fails
 * `bun run typecheck` (CI gate).
 *
 * The serialized-only direction (a `SerializedAgentSession` field with no
 * `AgentSessionState` counterpart) is guarded separately by the
 * `_serializedFieldsExistOnState` assertion below. The asymmetry is
 * deliberate: the serializer can only *drop* state fields, while the reader
 * could otherwise *invent* fields the live state does not have.
 *
 * This is NOT the same list as `TRANSIENT_SESSION_FIELDS` in
 * `src/session/snapshot-reader.ts` (fields RESET on rehydration — a subset of
 * the *serialized* fields). This map lists fields that are NEVER serialized.
 * Most are genuinely process-local; `workspaceDirectory` is deliberately
 * unserializable for trust reasons (see its TRUST BOUNDARY comment in
 * `src/state.ts`), which is exactly why it must carry an entry here rather
 * than fall out of the type silently.
 *
 * The runtime mirror of this guard lives at
 * `tests/unit/session/snapshot-field-parity-guard.test.ts` (what frozen
 * check C7 runs).
